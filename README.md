I needed a network map tool for my job...
networkmap.js had a good design, so I used it.

But it's buggy as HELL !

<br/>
I corrected bugs and added a lot of functionality...

You can now :

- Add nodes / links in the interface.
- Save your networkmap
- Use multiple networkmap
- Do requests from your browser ( and the server when CORS is blocking the request )
- Request with SNMP, use .rrd file.
- Use a password to prevent unwanted changes
- Zoom and move the map (buggy when editing)
- Use images
- More soon...

It's an unfinished version, but it work WAY better than the original project.
